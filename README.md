# Node App for CRUD operation
Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a popular software design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: 
the Model, the View, and the Controller. 
This pattern has been widely adopted by developers across various 
programming languages, including JavaScript, which is used in Node.
